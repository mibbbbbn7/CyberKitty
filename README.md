You will be playing as *Kitty*, a cat flying on an armed purple airplane that can shoot gold bullet hearts, aggressively dash towards enemies and shrink in size to dodge the attacks.
The game has 4 stages unlocked at 400, 800 and 1400 points. At each new stage of the game it becomes harder to survive with more and different types of enemies.
